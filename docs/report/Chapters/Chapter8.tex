\section{Fulfilment of Specification}



\section{Testing}



\subsection{Test Driven Development}

A fairly new (or at least recently popular) development methodology was used for the algorithms 

\subsection{Unit Testing}



\subsection{Code Coverage}



\subsection{Functional Testing}

Functional testing is a subset of black box testing that involves (mostly automatically) testing that user interface components work properly and buttons do what they're designed to do. However, it was decided in the case of Enigma that due to the low complexity of the software and use-flow, functional testing could be done manually to ensure that the software worked as properly.

\section{Summary}

Our final recommendation? Don't. Implementing your own algorithm is a bad idea
