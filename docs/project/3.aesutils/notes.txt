# Timing

It might be interesting to time algorithms and/or individual functions
for comparison later to built in capabilities.

# Finite Field Arithmetic

Need a function that multiplies to bytes together in the finite field
2^8.

Two sources for ideas:

1. WatneAES
  gfProduct()
2. Laws of Crypto
  FFMult
  FFMult using pre-computed tables (much faster)
  [Perhaps we can offer a choice?]

# Other

Might be interesting to include in report how S-boxes, etc are generated, 
or perhaps in the project documentation
