=====================
Aim
=====================
To implement utilities dealing with prime numbers and cryptographic applications based on them.

Abstract 
=====================

Modern cryptography allows us to perform many types of information exchange over insecure 
channels. One of these tasks is to agree on a secret key over a channel where messages can 
be overheard. This is achieved by Diffe-Hellman protocol. Other tasks include public key 
and digital signature schemes; RSA key exchange can be used for them. These protocols are 
of great importance for bank networks.

Most such algorithms are based upon number theory, namely, the intractability of certain 
problems involving prime numbers. The project involves implementing basic routines for 
dealing with prime numbers and then building cryptographic applications using them.

The project may be developed into several directions: modern algorithms for dealing with 
prime numbers, integration with symmetric techniques such as DES or AES, or cryptographic attacks.
