# Prime Numbers and Cryptosystems

My final year project, Enigma, a study in to algorithms based around prime numbers and their uses. The application is a simple chat testbed that I use to test algorithms, and the report is a discussion of the engineering behind this and the algorithms.

# Usage

Run the following command:

`$ rake`

This (will in the future) compile all the latex documents, compiles and builds a jar file and creates a neat distribution directory with all the things you would need to hand in a final year project on prime-number based cryptography.

# Licence

The entirety of this project -- this include all programming code, documentation, data, reports, latex source code, imagery, and any other files -- is released under the GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3 (LGPLv3).
